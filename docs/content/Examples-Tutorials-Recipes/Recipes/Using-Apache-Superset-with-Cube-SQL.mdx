## Use case

We want to connect a Cube project to [Apache Superset][apache-superset] using the Cube SQL API.
[Apache Superset][apache-superset] is an open-source data exploration and visualization platform,
commonly used to visualize business metrics and performance.

## Data schema



## Source code

Please feel free to check out the
[full source code](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/tree/master/examples/recipes/entity-attribute-value)
or run it with the `docker-compose up` command. You'll see the result, including
queried data, in the console.
